# Finite Element Method Implementation

This project aims to implement worked examples from the book "The Finite Element Method: A Practical Course" by G.R. Liu and S.S. Quek. It serves as a practical exercise in understanding and applying the finite element method (FEM) to structural mechanics problems.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into sections based on different types of structural elements:

-   **Trusses**: Implementation of truss element analysis. (WIP)
-   **Beams**: Implementation of beam element analysis. (Planned)
-   **Frames**: Implementation of frame element analysis. (Planned)
-   **Plates/Shells**: Implementation of plate and shell element analysis. (Planned)

## Current Status

Currently, the **Trusses** section is a work in progress.

### Truss Implementation Details

The truss implementation includes the following features:

-   Node and element classes for defining truss structures.
-   Calculation of element stiffness matrices.
-   Assembly of the global stiffness matrix.
-   Application of boundary conditions (supports).
-   Solution for nodal displacements.
-   Calculation of member forces (tension/compression).
-   Calculation of reaction forces at supports.
